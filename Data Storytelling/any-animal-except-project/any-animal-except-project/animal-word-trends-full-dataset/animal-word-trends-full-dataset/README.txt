The file 'animal-word-trends.csv' contains data on how often animal-related words have appeared in printed materials over time. This dataset tracks the historical usage frequency of nouns representing 3,920 different animals (e.g., "cat," "dogs," "elephant") from the year 1700 to 2019.

In this dataset, word frequency is calculated as the number of times a specific animal word appears in a given year, divided by the total number of words published that year, and then normalized to a scale of "per million words." For example, if "dog" appears 500 times in a year when 10 million words were published, its frequency would be 50 occurrences per million words.

The data comes from Google Ngrams, a tool that analyzes word usage in printed materials over time. For this dataset, we combined variations of each word—such as lowercase and uppercase (e.g., "dog" and "Dog"), as well as singular and plural forms (e.g., "cat" and "cats")—and focused only on nouns related to animals.
